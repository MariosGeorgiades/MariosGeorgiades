# Hi, I'm Marios! 🚀

I am a teenage developer and aspiring Software Engineer focused on **Systems Architecture**, **Competitive Programming**, and **Sustainable Tech**. Currently, I'm bridging the gap between low-level performance and high-level AI to build solutions for my home country.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- 🌍 **Maritime ML:** Developing an AI-driven platform to optimize routes and reduce carbon emissions for cargo ships- this is an idea in the making...
- 🤖 **Home Lab:** Architecting a private cloud on dual Linux servers, hosting local LLMs (Ollama) and automated microservices.
- 🏆 **Competitive Programming:** Refining algorithms for the Meta Hacker Cup and upcoming international hackathons.

### 💻 Technical Toolkit
* **Languages:** C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
* **Systems & DevOps:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), Server Management, Docker, Bash
* **Specialties:** Game Engine Architecture, Local AI Inference, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

### ⚡ Discipline & Performance
I believe physical endurance fuels cognitive performance.
* **Calisthenics & Weight Training:** Daily training focused on explosive power and strength.
* **Long-Distance Running:** Building the mental stamina required for long-form engineering challenges.
* **Continuous Learning:** Deep-diving into OS internals, kernel development, and advanced mathematics.

### 🎯 Strategic Goals
- [ ] Compete in the **Meta Hacker Cup**.
- [ ] Secure a Software Engineering internship at **Google** or **Microsoft**.
- [ ] Launch the MVP for my Maritime ML startup.
- [ ] Apply for the **Y Combinator** Winter/Summer batch.
