I’m a teenage programmer with a strong passion for game development and a growing dedication to competitive programming. Driven to shape my own career path, I thrive on learning both inside and outside the world of tech. Beyond coding, I’m enthusiastic about weight training, long-distance running, and calisthenics. I’m looking forward to participating in Facebook’s hackathon and aspire to become a software engineer at top tech companies like Google or Microsoft.
